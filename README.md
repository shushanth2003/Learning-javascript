### 💡 What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a **programming language** used to make websites **interactive**, **dynamic**, and **smart**.

It runs **in the browser** (like Chrome, Firefox) and can also run on the server using **Node.js**.

---

### 🚀 Why We Use JavaScript?

1. ✅ **Add interactivity** to web pages
   (e.g., buttons, forms, sliders)

2. ✅ **Control webpage content** dynamically
   (e.g., show/hide text, update without reloading)

3. ✅ **Handle user actions**
   (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input)

4. ✅ **Communicate with servers**
   (e.g., fetch data using APIs)

5. ✅ **Build full apps**
   (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)

### 🧠 One-liner Summary:

> JavaScript makes websites **come alive** by allowing **logic, interaction, and dynamic content.**

Sure, Shushanth! Here’s the **short and sweet theory** of **function scope** in JavaScript:

Absolutely, Shushanth! Here's a **short and sweet explanation** of **how JavaScript works** and **Execution Context** 🔥

---

## 🔧 How JavaScript Works (Behind the Scenes)

JavaScript runs inside a **JavaScript Engine** (like V8 in Chrome). It follows this process:

---

### ✅ 1. **Execution Context**

Whenever you run code, JS creates an **Execution Context** — a space to run your code.

It has **2 phases**:

---

### 🔹 Phase 1: **Memory Allocation (Creation Phase)**

* JS scans the code.
* It **allocates memory** for variables and functions.
* Variables are set to `undefined`, functions are stored as-is.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: **Code Execution (Execution Phase)**

* JS **runs the code line by line**.
* Variables get real values.
* Functions are executed if called.

---

## 🔁 Call Stack

* JS uses a **call stack** to track which function is running.
* **Last in, first out (LIFO)** style.

---

## 🧵 Is JavaScript Single or Multi-threaded?

* ✅ **Single-threaded**
  ➤ It runs **one thing at a time** (like a queue).

---

## ⏳ Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous?

* ✅ **Synchronous by default** (runs line by line)
* But with **Web APIs + callback queue**, JS can handle **Asynchronous tasks**
  ➤ Like `setTimeout()`, `fetch()`, etc.
