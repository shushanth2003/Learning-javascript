### 💡 What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a **programming language** used to make websites **interactive**, **dynamic**, and **smart**.

It runs **in the browser** (like Chrome, Firefox) and can also run on the server using **Node.js**.

---

### 🚀 Why We Use JavaScript?

1. ✅ **Add interactivity** to web pages
   (e.g., buttons, forms, sliders)

2. ✅ **Control webpage content** dynamically
   (e.g., show/hide text, update without reloading)

3. ✅ **Handle user actions**
   (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input)

4. ✅ **Communicate with servers**
   (e.g., fetch data using APIs)

5. ✅ **Build full apps**
   (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)

---

### 🧠 One-liner Summary:

> JavaScript makes websites **come alive** by allowing **logic, interaction, and dynamic content.**

## 🔧 How JavaScript Works (Behind the Scenes)

JavaScript runs inside a **JavaScript Engine** (like V8 in Chrome). It follows this process:

---

### ✅ 1. **Execution Context**

Whenever you run code, JS creates an **Execution Context** — a space to run your code.

It has **2 phases**:

---

### 🔹 Phase 1: **Memory Allocation (Creation Phase)**

* JS scans the code.
* It **allocates memory** for variables and functions.
* Variables are set to `undefined`, functions are stored as-is.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: **Code Execution (Execution Phase)**

* JS **runs the code line by line**.
* Variables get real values.
* Functions are executed if called.

---

## 🔁 Call Stack

* JS uses a **call stack** to track which function is running.
* **Last in, first out (LIFO)** style.

---

## 🧵 Is JavaScript Single or Multi-threaded?

* ✅ **Single-threaded**
  ➤ It runs **one thing at a time** (like a queue).

---

## ⏳ Is JavaScript Synchronous or Asynchronous?

* ✅ **Synchronous by default** (runs line by line)
* But with **Web APIs + callback queue**, JS can handle **Asynchronous tasks**
  ➤ Like `setTimeout()`, `fetch()`, etc.

---

## 🔥 Step-by-Step: How JavaScript Code is Executed

When you run JavaScript code, the JS engine (like V8 in Chrome) does this:

---

### ✅ 1. **Global Execution Context is created**

* This is the **default environment** where your code runs.
* It has two phases:

#### 🔹 a) **Memory Creation Phase**

* All variables and functions are **allocated memory**.
* Variables are set to `undefined`.
* Functions are stored as **reference**.

#### 🔹 b) **Code Execution Phase**

* Code is **executed line by line**.
* Variables get actual values.
* Functions are **invoked** (executed) when called.

---

## 🧠 Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

let name = "Shushanth";
greet();
```

### Execution Steps:

1. Memory Phase:

   * `greet` → stores function definition
   * `name` → `undefined`

2. Execution Phase:

   * `name = "Shushanth"`
   * `greet()` → function is **invoked**, goes into call stack

---

## 🧱 What is the Call Stack?

* JS uses a **Call Stack** to manage function execution.
* It works like a **stack of plates** (Last In, First Out).

---

### 📦 How it works:

```js
function one() {
  two();
  console.log("One");
}
function two() {
  console.log("Two");
}
one();
```

### Call Stack Steps:

1. `global()` is pushed
2. `one()` is called → pushed
3. `two()` is called → pushed
4. `console.log("Two")` → runs → `two()` is removed (popped)
5. `console.log("One")` → runs → `one()` is removed
6. `global()` is popped

---

## 🔼 What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

> **Hoisting** is the behavior where **variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope** during the **memory creation phase** of execution.

This happens **before** any code is actually run.

---

### 🧠 How It Works (Short Theory):

* In the **Memory Allocation Phase**, JS engine **scans the code**.
* It **hoists (lifts)**:

  * ✅ Function declarations — with full definition
  * ✅ `var` variables — with `undefined`
  * ❌ `let` and `const` are hoisted too, but **not initialized**

---

### ✅ Example 1: Hoisting with `var`

```js
console.log(name); // undefined (not error!)
var name = "Shushanth";
```

> JS hoisted `var name;` and set it as `undefined`, then assigned `"Shushanth"` in the execution phase.

---

### ✅ Example 2: Hoisting with `function`

```js
sayHello(); // Hello!

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

> Function is fully hoisted — so it works **even before** it's written.

---

### ❌ Example 3: `let` and `const` Hoisting

```js
console.log(age); // ❌ ReferenceError
let age = 21;
```

> `let` and `const` are hoisted, but stored in **"Temporal Dead Zone"** until they’re defined — so you get an error if you access them early.

---

## ✅ Summary:

| Declaration | Hoisted | Value (Before Init) | Can Use Before Declaring? |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `var`       | ✅ Yes   | `undefined`         | ✅ Yes (but risky)         |
| `let`       | ✅ Yes   | ❌ Not initialized   | ❌ No (ReferenceError)     |
| `const`     | ✅ Yes   | ❌ Not initialized   | ❌ No (ReferenceError)     |
| `function`  | ✅ Yes   | Full function       | ✅ Yes                     |

---

## 📦 What is Variable Environment?

> The **Variable Environment** is the memory space inside an execution context that holds **variables, function parameters, and inner function declarations**.

* Each function has **its own** variable environment.
* Inner scopes can **access outer scopes**, but not vice versa.

---

### ✅ Example with Nested Scope:

```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    let b = 20;
    console.log(a + b); // ✅ Can access a from outer
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
```

* `inner()` has its own variable env (`b`)
* It can **access `a`** from `outer()` due to **lexical scope**

---

## 🧠 Summary:

| Concept              | Meaning                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Function Call        | Creates a new execution context            |
| Variable Environment | Stores function's variables and params     |
| Lexical Scope        | Inner functions can access outer variables |
| Call Stack           | Tracks function calls in order (LIFO)      |

---

## ✅ 1. **Diagram: Function Call & Execution Context**

```
global()
│
├── outer() → [Execution Context Created]
│      ├── a = 10
│      └── inner() → [Execution Context Created]
│             └── b = 20
│             └── console.log(a + b) = 30
│
└── All contexts removed after execution (Call Stack is empty)
```

---
## ✅ The **Shortest JavaScript Program** is:

```js
// empty file
```

Yes! Even an **empty file** is a valid JavaScript program.

---

### 🚀 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When this empty file runs in the **browser**, JavaScript engine still creates:

1. **Global Execution Context**
2. **Global Object** → In the browser, it's called `window`
3. **this keyword** → Points to `window` in global scope

---

## 🪟 `window` – The Global Object in Browser

In a browser:

```js
console.log(window);
```

* It's an object created by the JS engine.
* It holds:

  * All global functions (`alert()`, `setTimeout()`, etc.)
  * All global variables
  * Browser APIs

---

## 🔑 `this` in Global Scope

In global scope:

```js
console.log(this);      // Points to window
console.log(this === window); // true ✅
```

So, any global variable you declare like:

```js
var name = "Shushanth";
console.log(window.name); // Shushanth
```

> Declaring with `var` adds it to the window object.
> But `let` and `const` DO NOT attach to window.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

| Concept          | Meaning                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Shortest JS Code | Empty file – still creates global context          |
| Global Object    | In browsers → `window`                             |
| `this` in global | Refers to `window` object                          |
| Global variables | `var` attaches to `window`, `let` & `const` do not |

You're on 🔥 fire, Shushanth!
Now let’s break down this super important topic in a **short, sweet, and clear** way:

---

## 🔍 Scope, Lexical Environment & Scope Chain in JavaScript

These concepts are **key** to how variables are accessed in JS — and they're 🔥 hot in interviews too!

---

### ✅ 1. **Scope** – Where a variable is accessible

> **Scope** determines where in your code a variable can be used.

* **Global Scope** – Accessible anywhere
* **Function Scope** – Only accessible inside a function
* **Block Scope** – `let` & `const` inside `{}`

---

### ✅ 2. **Lexical Environment**

> A Lexical Environment is created every time a function runs. It contains:

* **Local memory** (variables + functions defined inside)
* A reference to the **outer lexical environment**

---

### ✅ 3. **Scope Chain**

> The **Scope Chain** is the chain of lexical environments JS follows to **find a variable**.

When you access a variable:

1. JS looks in the **current scope**
2. If not found, it **goes up** the outer environment
3. Continues until it reaches **global scope**

---

### 🔁 Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;

  function inner() {
    let b = 20;
    console.log(a + b); // ✅ a is found in outer scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

🔗 **Scope Chain here:**

* `inner()` tries to find `a`
* It’s not in `inner()` → so it goes up to `outer()` and finds it there

---

## 🧠 Visual (Simplified)

```
inner() Lexical Env
├── b = 20
├── Reference → outer()

outer() Lexical Env
├── a = 10
├── Reference → global()

global() Lexical Env
```

---

## ✅ Summary:

| Term                | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Scope               | Where a variable is accessible                  |
| Lexical Environment | Local memory + reference to outer env           |
| Scope Chain         | The lookup path JS follows to resolve variables |

---

## ✅ `let` & `const` in JavaScript

They are modern ways to declare variables (introduced in ES6).
They are **block-scoped** and **not hoisted like `var`** (at least not the same way).

---

### 🚫 Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

> The **TDZ** is the time between when a variable is **hoisted** and when it is **initialized**.

During TDZ:

* You **can’t access** the variable
* If you try → ❌ **ReferenceError**

---

### 🔍 Example of TDZ:

```js
console.log(name);  // ❌ ReferenceError
let name = "Shushanth";
```

* `name` is hoisted **without initialization**
* It’s in the **Temporal Dead Zone** until this line: `let name = "Shushanth"`

---

## 🆚 Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const`

| Feature       | `var`                              | `let`                     | `const`                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Scope         | Function-scoped                    | Block-scoped              | Block-scoped              |
| Re-declare    | ✅ Allowed                          | ❌ Not allowed             | ❌ Not allowed             |
| Re-assign     | ✅ Allowed                          | ✅ Allowed                 | ❌ Not allowed             |
| Hoisted       | ✅ Yes (initialized to `undefined`) | ✅ Yes (but in TDZ)        | ✅ Yes (but in TDZ)        |
| Default Value | `undefined`                        | ❌ Error if accessed early | ❌ Error if accessed early |

---

### 🧠 Behind the Scenes (Memory Phase):

```js
// Memory Allocation Phase:
var a = undefined;
let b;   // In TDZ
const c; // In TDZ

// Execution Phase:
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = 30;
```

## 🔥 Types of Errors You Might See

| Error Type       | When it Happens                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ ReferenceError | Accessing variable in TDZ or undeclared var |
| ❌ TypeError      | Trying to reassign a `const`                |
| ❌ SyntaxError    | Bad syntax (e.g., missing brackets, etc.)   |

---

### ✅ Example:

```js
console.log(x);   // ❌ ReferenceError
let x = 5;

const y;          // ❌ SyntaxError (const must be initialized)
y = 10;

const z = 10;
z = 20;           // ❌ TypeError (can't change const)
```

---

## 💬 Summary:

* `let` & `const` are hoisted, but live in a **"Temporal Dead Zone"**
* They **cannot be used** before their declaration
* This helps **prevent bugs** and makes code **safer**

---

## 🧱 What is a Block in JavaScript?

> A **block** is anything inside `{ }`
> It can be used in:

* `if` / `else`
* `for` / `while`
* `function` body
* Plain `{ }` for grouping

```js
{
  // block
}
```

---

## 🧠 What is Block Scope?

> **Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside a block** are only accessible **inside that block**.

```js
{
  let a = 10;
  console.log(a); // ✅ Works
}
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError (a is block-scoped)
```

* `var` is NOT block-scoped (it is function-scoped)

---

## 🪞 What is Shadowing?

> **Shadowing** happens when a variable declared inside a block has the **same name** as a variable in an outer scope.

```js
let a = "outer";

{
  let a = "inner"; // ⬅️ shadows the outer 'a'
  console.log(a);  // inner
}

console.log(a);    // outer
```

✅ This is **legal shadowing** — and **common in real apps**.

---

## 🚫 What is Illegal Shadowing?

> When you try to declare a `let` or `const` variable **inside a block**, **while an outer scope already has a `var`** with the same name.

```js
var x = 10;

{
  let x = 20;  // ❌ Illegal Shadowing in strict mode
  console.log(x);
}
```

* `var` is hoisted to function/global scope
* You **can't safely shadow** it using `let` or `const`
* This throws an error in **strict mode**

✅ Safe option: **Avoid using `var`** — use only `let`/`const`

---

## 📋 Summary:

| Concept           | Explained                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Block Scope       | `let`/`const` visible only inside `{ }`        |
| Shadowing         | Inner variable hides outer with same name      |
| Legal Shadowing   | `let`/`const` shadowing outer `let`/`const`    |
| Illegal Shadowing | `let`/`const` shadowing outer `var` (⚠️ error) |

Absolutely, Shushanth! 🙌
**Closures** are one of the most powerful (and interview-loved 🔥) concepts in JavaScript — and I’m going to explain them **super clearly and simply** for you.

---

## 🔐 What is a Closure in JavaScript?

> A **closure** is created when a function **remembers** the **variables from its outer scope**, even **after the outer function has finished executing**.

---

### ✅ In Simple Words:

A closure means:

* A function inside another function
* The inner function **keeps access** to the outer function’s variables

Even **after** the outer function is **done running**, the inner function can **still access** its variables 🔥

---

## 📦 Closure Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log("Count is", count);
  }

  return inner;
}

const counter = outer(); // outer() runs, returns inner()

counter(); // Count is 1
counter(); // Count is 2
counter(); // Count is 3
```

---

### 🧠 What’s Happening?

* `outer()` runs and sets `count = 0`
* It **returns** the `inner()` function
* Even though `outer()` is **finished**, `inner()` still **remembers** `count`

➡️ **That's a closure!**

---

## 📚 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a **child function** (`inner`) keeping a **backpack** of everything its **parent function** (`outer`) had.

Even when the parent is gone, the child still has access to that backpack. 🎒

---

## 🧹 Closures & Garbage Collection

* Normally, variables are **deleted** when a function finishes.
* But in **closures**, variables are **kept alive** (in memory) **as long as the inner function uses them**

✅ That’s how closures can **retain data**.

---

## 💡 Where Closures Are Used:

| Use Case                    | Real Example                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Data privacy                | Encapsulate variables                     |
| Function factories          | Create customized functions               |
| setTimeout/setInterval      | Delay actions using remembered state      |
| React Hooks (like useState) | Behind the scenes, hooks use closures! 🔥 |
